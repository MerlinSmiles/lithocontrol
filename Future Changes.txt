Future Changes:

Json settings file
    import json

    with open('config.json', 'r') as f:
        config = json.load(f)

    #edit the data
    config['key3'] = 'value3'

    #write it back to the file
    with open('config.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(config, f)

Console output should be captured

Logging store should add timestamps by itself
    - just use system time
    - use an initial starting time, but init it during creation.
